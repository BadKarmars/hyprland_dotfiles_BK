Hi, 

First repo. It is a .config directory which contains all my dotfiles for DE using Hyprland. 
  - It is a bit messy and some lines in config files are useless.
  - Some config files are used from the MyLinux4Work repo of S. Raabe.
  - I recommand using stow to manage dotfiles because it is easier.

Thanks.
